# A Solutions Manual

This is an *unofficial* solutions manual for @hastie2015. I happily
accept additions to the solutions through pull requests on github.

## Compiling this Book

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

<!-- ```{r include=FALSE} -->
<!-- # automatically create a bib database for R packages -->
<!-- knitr::write_bib(c( -->
<!--   .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown' -->
<!-- ), 'packages.bib') -->
<!-- ``` -->
